HydroGen Pro - Advanced H2 Infrastructure
Overview
HydroGen Pro is an interactive GIS-based platform designed to accelerate the growth of the green hydrogen ecosystem. It provides a data-driven tool for urban planners, energy companies, and policy analysts to visualize, analyze, and optimize hydrogen infrastructure investments.

The platform integrates multi-layered data—including infrastructure assets, renewable energy potential, demand centers, and regulatory zones—onto a single, intuitive map. It features an AI-powered analysis engine that uses real-world data to recommend optimal sites for new projects, enabling evidence-based decision-making.

Key Features
Interactive GIS Mapping: A dynamic map interface powered by Leaflet.js that visualizes all key data layers, including production plants, storage facilities, and pipelines.

AI-Powered Site Selection: An intelligent analysis engine that takes user criteria and real-world data from the NASA POWER API to recommend optimal locations for new projects.

Dynamic Search: A real-time search feature that queries the backend to find locations, assets, and coordinates, providing instant results.

Layer Management: A collapsible panel that allows users to easily toggle the visibility of different data layers on the map.

Status Dashboard: A heads-up display (HUD) that shows key performance indicators for the hydrogen network.

Technology Stack
Frontend:

HTML5/CSS3: Structure and styling, including modern glassmorphism effects.

JavaScript: Core logic for interactivity.

Leaflet.js: An open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps.

Leaflet.heat: A plugin for visualizing heat maps.

Font Awesome: A library for icons.

Backend:

Python 3.x: The programming language for the server-side logic.

Flask: A lightweight web framework for creating the API endpoints.

Requests: A Python library for making HTTP requests to external APIs (e.g., NASA POWER).

Installation and Setup
To run the application, you need to have Python 3.x and pip installed.

File Setup:

Ensure both FRONTEND.html and app.py files are in the same directory.

Install Dependencies:

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where your files are saved.

Install the required Python libraries using pip:

Bash

pip install Flask requests
Run the Application:

Start the Flask server from your terminal:

Bash

python app.py
You will see a message indicating the server is running.

Open your web browser and navigate to the address:

http://127.0.0.1:5000
Usage
Toggle Layers: Use the switches in the "Layers" tab to show and hide different data on the map.

Run AI Analysis: Go to the "AI" tab, adjust the sliders to define your criteria, and click "Run AI Analysis." The backend will fetch real-world data, run a mock analysis, and display the optimal sites on the map and in the "Results" tab.

Search: Use the search bar in the "Search" tab to find specific locations, infrastructure assets, or even coordinates. The results will appear dynamically below.

Future Enhancements
Advanced AI Models: Implement more sophisticated machine learning models for predictive analytics and network optimization.

Persistent Database: Replace the Python dictionary dataset with a real database (e.g., PostgreSQL with PostGIS) to handle larger-scale, persistent data.

User Authentication: Add user accounts and role-based access control.

Real-time Data Feeds: Integrate with live data APIs for up-to-the-minute updates on energy prices, weather, and market demand.
